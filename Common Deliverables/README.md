# Risk of Kane
## Quake 4 Mod by Austin Fontaine


# Additions

## Curses and Powerups
In addition to the usual powerups, I added some curses, just to add some risk to random pickups.
    - **Curse of Levitation**: You float for 30 seconds. Have fun on the way down!
    - **Curse of Blindness**: A black flash blinds you for about 30 seconds.
    - **Curse of Pressure**: The world is exerting its Pressure! Each shot you make uses up double the ammo.
    - **Curse of... Drunk, You're Drunk Now**: Stumbling movements? Blurry vision? Must've had too much to drink!
    - **Splash Suit**: This one isn't a curse. Protects you from all splash damage for a time. 

## Knacks
Knacks are like the "personal superpower" trope a couple anime have, or ultimate abilities in some video games. You can only have one at a time. Each knack either grants a passive effect or can be activated by the voice chat button. I recommend setting it to Q. There are four Knacks implemented:
    - **Bloodlust**: Attacking heals you by 20% of damage dealt.
    - **Empathy Shield**: Your enemies feel your pain and receive 25% of the damage they deal to you.
    - **Teleporter**: Your own personal teleporter! Activate it to teleport to a random spawn point on the map.
    - **Substitute**: In a pinch? Activate this knack to leave behind an empty copy of yourself to take the fall while you make a break for it. It won't fool the enemies for long, though!

## New Enemies
Some enemies have been converted to new monsters. The models are the same, so you'll have to use your imagination.
    - **Golem** *(formerly Grunt)*: Incredibly tanky but doesn't hit too hard. Once you've finally depleted its health, you'll be surprised when it breaks apart into two Golemites! Each of these Golemites have the same attacks, but a third of the health of the original.
    - **Baby Dragon** *(formerly Sentry)*: This fire breathing baby doesn't seem like much of a threat when it's with its friends. But when it's separated from other Baby Dragons, it will erupt into a rage!
    - **Wendigo** *(formerly Light Tank)*: Be careful where you wave that flashlight around- shine it on this monster and it'll get pissed off, turning off your flashlight and blinding you for a short time!
    - **Intoxigator** *(formerly Slimy Transfer)*: Get some cold water ready, because this a taste of this groggy gator's alcoholic spit will get you drunk for a short time! *Note: Intoxigator spit is not fit for consumption or wound sterilization due to its concentration of stomach acid.*
    - **Bob-omb** *(formerly Ground Convoy)*: Don't let this one get too close. From a distance, it'll only shoot at you. But once it touches you, its fuse will light and you'll have 3 seconds to run before it blows up.
## New Weapons
10 weapons have been revamped to fit the new gameplay.
    - **Sword** *(replaces Gauntlet)*: Slash your way to victory with this epic sword! You can also charge a powerful stab with it.
    - **Inferno Rod** *(replaces Lightning Gun)*: Bring the heat with this powerful magical weapon! The Inferno Rod fires a continuous beam. When fired on one target continuously, the target's health will melt away at an exponential rate!
